OCR enhancement project.

The quality of the KB-newspaper archive should be enhanced.
OCR software has evolved since the newspapers where digitized,
therefore we're exploring the idea of re-OCR'ing mutiple pages.

Takes a newspaper as input, looks at the OCR confidence value,
if this value is below a certain threshold, re-OCR the image.
For comparison the old OCR is presented, and for good measure
there is also some output stats about the text.
